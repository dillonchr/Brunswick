Named after the good people that do bowling stuff. This is to do batch handbrake conversions of
various types of video files. I don't think it's important to do this anymore thanks to Plex.

I thought I'd return to it to give it another go now that I have a means to work with Xcode again.
This is incredibly brittle, I really wouldn't advise anyone in their right mind use this.

In fact, I'm kinda wondering if I can just reduce this whole thing into a shell script. Find, look
for extensions I want, without the sample prefix, and pipe them through handbrake one at a time. But what're ya gonna do?
